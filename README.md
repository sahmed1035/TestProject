1) What the project does
#Description
As a parent when relocating , finding a new home, parents want to make sure the high school rating for that area as well as neibhorhood safety. 
Our app "My-You-Topia", helps our customers find their ideal neighborhood with their concerns of community safety and school performance. We developed the app as a data gatherer targeting families with children, looking for a new place to live.
The problem that the product will address is to make it easy to find school information that best suits family interests. Close to home, transportation, restaurants. (College preparatory, religious schools, Montessori schools, low cost schools, )
Our target audience are parents looking for school information, specifically location and ratings and crime data.

This project solves a critical issue families with school going children face. Neighborhood saftey and school ranking.

3) Challenges you experienced
APIs had limits on the number of times to use them per day. Some required debit/credit card use. The real estate websites only provided information regarding real estate information. Also, we had to do a lot of research to get the apis in a format we could use. The closest we got to a JSON format for the school api was for Great Schools. Other challenges we experienced were narrowing down the ideas we brainstormed to one concept and using XMLHttpRequest instead of ajax for the school's xml. Towards the end we encountered issues being able to combine all of the code together especially creating arrays and variables for the map and making sure they were in the correct format for the school api.
We had to cleanup the Typed.js file to work the way we wanted. 
Also for the FBI API we added core link as well as the browser extension.
